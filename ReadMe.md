# Usage uTerrain Displacement Shader:
- Texture 1: VertexColour.r
- Texture 2: VertexColour.b
- Texture 3: VertexColour.g
- Texture 4: VertexColour.a
- Texture 5: VertexUV2.x
- Texture 6: VertexUV2.y

**If you use uTerrain with the Shader, make sure to disable "Duplicate Vertices" in the Terrain Inspector, and it works out of the box.**

# Usage uTerrain Culling and LOD System:
Drag and drop the script on your uTerrain game object and assign the terrain in the inspector, optional can you assign a shadow only material and set up a LOD for textures which is perfect for my shader setup in this repo.
